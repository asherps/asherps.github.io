          <p>Fall was good! More fun and more productive than all previous semesters and probably a life high overall. I didn't prioritize right, but I got a lot done. I also got closer to a lot of great people.</p>

          <h2>Some miscellaneous highlights:</h2>
          <p>I roomed with one of my closest friends, went to a bunch of concerts, visited the Harvard AI safety folks a lot, starting working out with a gym bro, worked on a research project that was unusually fun, hosted a birthday party where friends from different walks of life all came together, went to ABC, went to two more MAIA/AISST retreats (co-led the first), got to the top of the dunster house bell tower at Harvard, and took a lot of walks. Towards the end of the semester, my AI urgency levels hit a whole new high, especially with the o1 release. I'm going to go to the Bay in January to work on white box monitoring with Redwood.</p>

          <h2>Course reviews:</h2>
          
          <h3>18.404 — Theory of Computation</h3>
          <div class="course-details">
            <p>• SO FUN! Pretty useless I'm sure, but so fucking fun. Felt like doing logic puzzles as a class. ToC problems involved making a lot of creative, abstract connections, which was really interesting for reflecting on my thinking patterns.</p>
            
            <p>• Got a 56 on the midterm and a 98 on the final.</p>
            
            <p>• This is the sort of class that AIs are really bad at; I think it's very reliant on the most abstract parts of general reasoning.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>6.7480 — Graduate Information Theory</h3>
          <div class="course-details">
            <p>• This really didn't focus on the material I was hoping it would. Channel coding gets hopelessly boring after a month or two.</p>
            
            <p>• But it was interesting nonetheless, especially during the first half of the course.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>8.02 — Electricity and Magnetism</h3>
          <div class="course-details">
            <p>• Really fun material. Wish the class was more conceptual and less algebra bashing but alas.</p>
            
            <p>• Made me really jealous of the alternate reality where I get to become a physicist.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>14.73 — Challenge of World Poverty</h3>
          <div class="course-details">
            <p>• Material was pretty interesting, and the professor was awesome, but the classes themselves weren't great because we were just making presentations.</p>
            
            <p>• Each week I spent 1.5 hours in lecture and about 2 hours outside of lecture, so this wasn't a big part of my life anyway.</p>
