      <h1>About Me</h1>
        <br>
      <section class="about-section">
        <p>
          I like nighttime walks, violin, humidity, meditation, basketball, reading, music, rain, and the peaks of minor melodies.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also like  climbing things, being happy for my friends, long conversations that change the way I see the world, and feeling like all music sounds better than usual.
        </p>
        <p>
        I also like parties, meditation, and admiring trees. I don't like museums because trees are more beautiful than paintings and history. 
        </p>

        <p>
          I like both {long, intense conversations} and {existing together in silence}.
        </p>

        <p>
        Most of my values in day-to-day life surround things like being unusually kind and empathetic in relationships and doing my best to embody the sorts of norms i wish existed everywhere.
        Eg, I try very hard not to let other people’s judgements affect what i do, because i don’t want to create the sort of culture where other people are encouraged to give in to negative judgements.
        </p>

        <p>
        I consider my dayjob to be making sure AI goes well for the world, so I spend unreasonable amounts of time unraveling the details of how this might happen. I could talk about this for days on end. 
        </p>

        <p>
        I also enjoy thinking about AI theory more than I do most other subjects. It feels like a projection of intuitive properties of the world onto the domain of math. Physics also has this property.
        </p>

        <p>
        I'm not reflective enough, I have very little emotional self-awareness, I don't trust myself enough, and I sometimes subconciously limit how close I get with other people. I also have deeper flaws which won't make it to this website.
        </p>

        <p>
        Some frames i like include ifs, libertarian paternalism, decision-theoretic time-coherence, <a href="blog/appreciation.html">appreciation</a>, kantianism, consequentialism, and affective presence.</p>

        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>
          I studied at MIT, focusing on AI, math, and physics. Currently, I'm working at Redwood Research on making AI systems safer.
